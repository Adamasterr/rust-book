Which of the following is NOT a valid kind of fix to the issue of returning a stack reference from a function?

A stack frame cannot have its lifetime extended, so that is not a valid solution.

Which of the following best explains why an `i32` can be copied without a move, but a `String` cannot?

If a value owns data on the heap, then copying it creates an alias, and so it is moved-on-copy.

This program does compile, as the binding of `x` copies `point[0]`, allowing `y` to mutable borrow `point[]`.
The mutation `x += 1` does not affect `point`, while the mutation `*y += 1` does, so the final result is `0 2`.
