Rust does not have a keyword for constructors. The idiomatic way to define a constructor is to make an associated function called `new`,
but that is not enforced by the language.

Consider these two methods that increment a field of a struct. Which style would be more idiomatic for Rust?

```
struct Point(i32, i32);
impl Point {
  fn incr_v1(mut self)  { self.0 += 1; }
  fn incr_v2(&mut self) { self.0 += 1; }

The `incr_v1` method is not idiomatic, because it consumes ownership of the `Point`. This means after calling `p.incr_v1()`, `p` 
would be unusable, which is probably not intended for this method.

Because `get_x` mutably borrows all of `p`, a program cannot use `p` in any way until `x` is no longer used. 
Therefore reading `x` and `p.y` in the same line is an ownership error.
