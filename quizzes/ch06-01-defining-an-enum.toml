Rust does not have null pointers, so the `null` keyword does not exist. An Option type should be used to represent the possibility of an object being null.

Consider these two representations of a `Result` type that contains a value `T` if a computation succeeds, or an error `E` if it fails.

```
struct Result1<T, E> {
  ok: Option<T>,
  err: Option<E>,
}

enum Result2<T, E> {
  Ok(T),
  Err(E)
}
```

The enum `Result2` is considered more idiomatic than the struct `Result1` in Rust. Which is NOT a valid reason why?
"""
prompt.choices = [
  "The struct uses more space in memory at runtime than the enum",
  "The struct contains `Option` types, which are only intended to wrap structs",
  "The struct could have `ok` and `err` both be `None`, while the enum must have at least one them",
  "The struct is more syntactically verbose to construct than the enum",

It's perfectly fine to have structs contain `Option` types as fields. But if your data structure has invariants like "exactly one of two optional fields should be `Some`",
then that invariant is better ensured by use of an enum.
