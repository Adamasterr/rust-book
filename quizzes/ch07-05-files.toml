Imagine a Rust package with the following directory structure:

```text
foobar
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    ├── lib.rs
    └── impl/
        ├── mod.rs
        └── analysis.rs
```

The contents of each file are:


```
// impl/analysis.rs
pub fn run() {}
```

```
// impl/mod.rs
mod analysis;
pub use analysis::*;
```

```
// lib.rs
pub mod impl;
```

Say that another Rust developer is using the `foobar` library crate in a separate package, and they want to call the `run` function. 
What is the path they would write?

answer.answer = "foobar::impl::run"

The module tree generated by this directory structure is as follows:

```text
foobar
└── impl
    └── run  
```

Therefore the path to `run` is `foobar::impl::run`.
