Consider a program with the following unit test:

```
#[test]
fn test_the_logger() { /* ... */ }

#[test]
fn test_the_database() { /* ... */ }

#[test]
fn test_logger_and_database() { /* ... */ }
```

What is the *shortest* string you can pass to `cargo test <the_string>` such that *only* `test_the_logger` and `test_the_database` are executed?
"""
answer.answer = "th"
context = """
The shortest substring string that is not contained in `test_logger_and_database` but is contained in `test_the_logger` and `test_the_database`
is "th" (the prefix of "the").
