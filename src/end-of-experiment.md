# End of Experiment

Thank you for participating in our experiment! We hope you got something useful from our additions. Your participation will help make Rust better for everyone.

This experiment only covers about half of The Rust Programming Language, so you should continue learning with Chapter 13 of the actual book: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-features.html>
