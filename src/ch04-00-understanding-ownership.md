# Understanding Ownership

Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest
of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without
needing a garbage collector, so it’s important to understand how ownership
works. In this chapter, we’ll talk about ownership as well as several related
features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.

fn get_or_default(arg: &Option<String>) -> String {
    if arg.is_none() {
        return String::new();
    }
    let s = arg.unwrap();
    s.clone()
}

fn main() {
    let s_opt = Some(String::from("Hello world"));
    get_or_default(&s_opt);
}
```
